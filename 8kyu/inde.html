There will be doubts, there will be a lack of motivation, there will be moments of confusion when working with Figma and Webflow. But a good community can really pull you out of those moments, show you the way or simply give you a word of encouragement.</p><p>So I've created a student hangout on <strong>Discord</strong>. I didn't actually come up with this idea on my own. <strong>The students did</strong>. Many asked me for a place where they could connect and chat with other students. What a great idea.</p><p><strong> Join the </strong><a href="https://vakoshvili.com/discord" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>hangout here</strong></a><strong>. </strong>(Try this <a href="https://vakoshvili.com/discord-alt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alternative link</a> if the first one doesn't work)</p><p>There you can chat directly with other students from the course, share content, exchange ideas, help each other with design, Figma, Webflow, and make friends.</p><p><strong> While you are at it, join this </strong><a href="https://discord.gg/CCz8Yrw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Webflow Community</strong></a><strong> too.</strong></p><p>It's on Discord as well and they are incredibly helpful there.</p>
